The command that is invoked by the makefile to compile this example is

	$ ../../src/texerupter -p tikz,pgfplots --img="class=\"block\"" --eq-inline="class=\"eqinline\"" example.html

To execute it, type 'make'. This generates SVG-Files example.html.<n>.svg and a modified HTML file erupted_example.html. Note that the 3d plot needs a few moments to render.

This example serves to show how the powerful plotting and drawing TikZ/PGFPlots routines can be used to generate SVGs. Note that all code that is necessary to draw these pictures is contained within the <tex>-tags.

Since the drawing routines are part of the TikZ and PGFPlots packages, we need to include the packages in the LaTeX header. To achieve this, we can simply specify the -p option with a comma separated list (no whitespace!) of the packages. In this case: -p tikz,pgfplots.

In addition the options --img="class=\"block\"" and --eq-inline="class=\"eqinline\"" are passed to TexErupter. These strings will be used as attributes to the <img>-tags that are generated from <tex> and <$> environments, respectively. The CSS classes block and eqinline are defined in the HTML header.

Open erupted_example.html in your Webbrowser to view the result.

If you want to examine what kind of LaTeX file has been generated or if there's been some kind of exception, use the verbose option: -v.
