The command that is invoked by the makefile to compile this example is

   $ ../../src/texerupter example.html

To execute it, type 'make'. This generates the SVG example.html.1.svg and a modified HTML file erupted_example.html.

This example is just to show the basic functionality. The contents of the <tex>-tag are inserted verbatim into a LaTeX document, rendered to a PDF and transformed to an SVG. The <tex>-environment is then replaced by an <img>-tag that has the generated SVG as its 'src' attribute.

Open erupted_example.html in your Webbrowser to view the result.

If you want to examine what kind of LaTeX file has been generated, use the verbose option
   
   $ ../../src/texerupter -v example.html

All intermediate files will be kept and you can examine the example.html.tex file.
